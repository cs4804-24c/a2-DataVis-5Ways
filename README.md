Technical Achievements
For the entirety of the graphs, I used the same hex codes to maintain uniformity throughout my visualizations. Additionally, when the software permitted, I changed the graph background and grids to match the original image.

Tableau
I have used Tableau before, but not for an assignment like this. Since this visualization is a bit more particular about smaller scale details, that was a new task I had to tackle within Tableau. However, I enjoy the interface of Tableau and find it relatively seamless to navigate. The only issue I have within Tableau is undoing errors, but luckily I did not run into that too frequently with this task.

Python
Python is not my coding language of choice, however I learned a good deal of it through my datamining course I took earlier this year, so brushing up on this skills were nice. I did not run into any major issues with this language. 

R
R is probably my favorite coding language. This was by far the easiest visualization to create, and the code was super brief as well. 

DataWrapper
Datawrapper was a tool I have not ever used before, but I will definitely use it again in the future. It was super easy and intuitive, and produced a pretty graph. The only issue was that for when I first loaded in my data, it somehow deleted the bill_depth_mm column? But reloading and reuploading the .csv fixed it. 

D3
D3 I ran into the most issues, just because I am not used to coding something, saving it, opening my browser, and then uploading it there. On the first of many attempts, the loaded page was blank, no matter which browser I used and how much I tried to fix my code. Finally, one of my groupmembers pointed me to using glitch, which was far easier to write my code in. I like how it provided real time updates for how my code was changing my visualization.

Bonus!
Vega-Lite
I was excited to try Vega-Lite, especially with the description on the assignment calling it the “potential future of the field”. I did my research on the syntax, and completed the code which was surprisingly short. However, the issue came when it was time to insert my data. Since the ide is online, it did not permit me to upload a .csv, so I needed to host it online. This was something I had never done before. I exhausted many options, such as creating a .json Gist on GitHub, a public google sheet, .csv publishers, and even manually copy and pasting the data in. None of these options worked, and to be frank, Vega-Lite broke me. This is when I turned to a different option, eventually landing on DataWrapper, which as previously stated, worked much better.
