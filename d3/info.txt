To properly run the index.html file it must be in the same folder as "penglings2.csv". penglings 2 has two penguins removed from it, both of which had 'Na' values for most of their entries. I potentially could have filtered out the Na values, but performing manual data cleaning was not very difficult in this case scenerio. Otherewise there would have been circle artifacts at the corner of the vizualization (though this may not longer be the case due to bill length being connected to the circles' sizes. The html files may need to be run using a local host server.
