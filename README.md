I used this resource to get started with making the scatter plot (including the svg and the axes): https://d3-graph-gallery.com/graph/custom_theme.html
However I modified it in the following ways: Ensure the axes were on the correct scale, edit text and colors to make sure that everything corresponded to the assignment's details, and overhauled the csv parsing to first convert the strings in each of the rows to numbers, and use a promise to ensure the csv file would be loaded before beginning to add the points on the plot. I also added the variation in point size according to bill length and added the style for 80% opacity. Additionally, I added a legend to show the meaning of the point size and point color.
