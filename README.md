# altair + python + jupyter notebooj

![caption](img/<altair.png>)
Python is a general-purpose programming language. Altair is a visualization library in Python. Jupyter Notebook is a web-based interactive computing platform that creates interactive notebook documents containing live code, equations, visualizations, media, and other computational outputs. 

To visualize the penglings dataset, I used altair's Chart.encode() method. This allows easy encoding of the data.

Documentation was easy to find, and my previous experience in Python also made this visualizion very easy to make. 

* Design achievements: I matched the colors to the example by scanning for the exact RGB code. I used altair's domain and range parameters with the scale method to assign my own colors. I also added a title and subtitle, which involved passing the title keyword argument with data.
* Technical achievements: My visualization is interactive. You can pan and zoom on the chart. This is done using interactive(). 

# ggplot2 + R + RStudio
