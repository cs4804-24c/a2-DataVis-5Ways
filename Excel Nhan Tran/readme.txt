
Excel Visualization
Bubble Plot
The bubble plot in Excel provides a visual representation of the relationship between flipper length, body mass, and bill length for individual penguins. Each data point on the plot represents a penguin, with colors and point sizes indicating different attributes. However, the bubbles may appear overlit, which is not ideal for visibility. Additionally, a line showing the average attributes of each penguin is included, but it may be hidden behind the data points, making it challenging to see.

Data Manipulation
Manual manipulation of the dataset was necessary in Excel to organize the data into separate categories for each penguin in separate columns. While this added complexity, it allowed for better organization and analysis of the data.

Interactive Features
While there are no specific interactive features in Excel, the visualization includes a lot of information for viewers to explore. The data is presented alongside the graph, allowing viewers to easily change or add data points for further analysis.

Future Enhancements
To improve this visualization in Excel, efforts could be made to enhance the visibility of the bubbles and the average attribute line. Additionally, incorporating more interactive features, such as tooltips or filtering options, could enhance the user experience and make the visualization more interactive.
