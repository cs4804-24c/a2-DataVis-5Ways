# R + ggplot2 + R Markdown

R is a language primarily focused on statistical computing.
ggplot2 is a popular library for charting in R.
R Markdown is a document format that compiles to HTML or PDF and allows you to include the output of R code directly in the document.

To visualized the cars dataset, I made use of ggplot2's `geom_jitter()` layer, with aesthetics functions for the size. For the color I mapped the species names directly to the colors of my choice 

It took some time to get used to all the syntax and figure out an approach to creating the chart by this was the easiest of the languages for me to pick up.
