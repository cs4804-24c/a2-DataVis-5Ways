# Python + Seaborn
I have experience working with python and seabon specifically, so working with this specific package was simple for me. But I also did learn how to use specific features like

# Python + Altair
I have experience with python but

# DataWrapper
This was my first time using it and it was very simple to interact with however the customability use was a bit difficult. Trying to incorporate all the custom features too some time but there is a spot for experiementaion. That requires a seperate level of skill. This platform would be useful for work that is static and does not need complex queries otherwise this tool may not be sufficient to fulfill all data visualization need. I personally did not have any trouble with would through this platform, especially for data manipulation. When I loaded the data all I had to do was to ignore the NA's in the data. I would use this in the future to work through simple visualizations. (need premium for access to customization --> image in image folder)

# Flourish
This was my first time using this and it was similar to datawrapper, but if I had to choose it would be a more compatability platform than datawrapper since there were certain customability that I liked in this platoform. There is an interacive dropdown but it groups by species and not the kind of interactivity I was attemping. Also the filter is limited so for static view and simple interactions can be done. Major visual would be difficult to be used. I would use this in the future but not for major visualizations.

# D3
Personally I had the most trouble with d3 since it is something I needed to work through

## Technical Achievements
- **Python + Altair + Seaborn**: For both I added a feature that can turn on and off the color mapping and size maping. When the user wants to focus on a specific feature then it can be turn off to revert to a standard color or standard size this is included in the legend. 
- **D3**: I added a feature that can turn on and off the color mapping and size maping. When the user wants to focus on a specific feature then it can be turn off to revert to a standard color or standard size. Also a tooltip for interactions. the legend had to be added manually.


### Design Achievements
- **All**: I tried to maintain all the graphs to have the same color correlated to the same species name.
