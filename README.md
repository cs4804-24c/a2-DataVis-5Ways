Assignment 2 - Data Visualization, 5 Ways  
===
# Excel
Excel is a powerful spreadsheet application used for organizing, formatting, and calculating data in a tabular format. To visualize this data, I needed to create a bubble chart with three series, one for each species of pengling, with the x values being the flipper length and the y values being the body mass. Also, I needed to add the bill length to each series to correspond to the size of the data points.

# R + ggplot2 + R Markdown

R is a language primarily focused on statistical computing.
ggplot2 is a popular library for charting in R.
R Markdown is a document format that compiles to HTML or PDF and allows you to include the output of R code directly in the document.

To visualized the cars dataset, I made use of ggplot2's `geom_point()` layer, with aesthetics functions for the color and size.

While it takes time to find the correct documentation, these functions made the effort creating this chart minimal.
