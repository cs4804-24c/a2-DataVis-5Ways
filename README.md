# altair + python + jupyter notebooj

Python is a general-purpose programming language. Altair is a visualization library in Python. Jupyter Notebook is a web-based interactive computing platform that creates interactive notebook documents containing live code, equations, visualizations, media, and other computational outputs. 

To visualize the penglings dataset, I used altair's Chart.encode() method. This allows easy encoding of the data.

Documentation was easy to find, and my previous experience in Python also made this visualizion very easy to make. 

* Description of the Design achievements you attempted with this visualization: I matched the colors to the example by scanning for the exact RGB code.
