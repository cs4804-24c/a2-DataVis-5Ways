#R - ggplot 2
![Gg plot 2 final result](img/ggplot.png)
Reflection:
Given the example in class and the extensive R library resources it was very easy to satisfy all the requirments and add onto them to create a more comprehensive view of the data which allowed to look at almost all of the columns provided. I think this method can be extremely useful when working with large data sets with a lot of columns. One hack that I used was to find the best way to represent the relationships between all the data columns and to make sure that the user did not get overwhelmed.
Technical Achievements: clean the data, separate based on all column values, enhance the code provided in class.
Design Achievments: separated everything based on year, included legends for all the shapes/colours, added trend lines to all the graphs.Consistent scales/shapes/colours allow for better user experience
