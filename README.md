I started with JS/d3. I used d3.csv() to import my data into the plot and <canvas> instead of const width/const height. I used the d3 website the most to help me through the process of all the functions. (https://d3js.org/ and https://stackoverflow.com/questions/15417437/d3-js-loading-local-data-file-from-file just to try to get it explained to me)

# Python + matplot.lib

I've only coded in Python a handful of times, and thankfully during one of my classes last year we made a similar graph so I had a pretty good idea of how to do this one. I used Jupyter Notebook (provided by WPI) to compile everything. I used matplot.lib and matplotlib.lines. 

# R + ggplot

I've worked with R a fair amount in the past, I used the library ggplot2. I used ggplot2 in both statistics classes I've taken over the past 2 years here. Pretty much the same as tidyverse, but a different library. The plot was minimal effort but pleasing. 

# Tableau

I had never heard of Tableau before so I wanted to see what it was all about. I really liked this tool, it was really straightforward and had a drag and drop system. Once you upload your CSV it's all very simple from there. It allows you to add a ton of features to your plots like different shapes or outlining said shapes. I implemented a legend and the same color scheme as the original plots. 

# Datawrapper

Datawrapper was similar to Tableau in the sense of simplicity. It's a free online data visualizer that has you upload your data and refine all your data to make the plot how you'd like. It was more 'difficult' to learn than Tableau, so I went through their website to learn a little more about it. I added tooltips when you hover over each data point and the same color pallette using HEX codes. 

# Technical Achievements
* I implemented the brush function in my d3, python, and Datawrapper examples so the user can see the data of each point summarized.
* I used the ggplot2 library in my R+ggplot example rather than tidyverse

# Design Achievements
* All of the plots have legends.
* All plots have the same color scheme as the original example.
